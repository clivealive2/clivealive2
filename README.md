- Hi I am Clive, I have been building a website for my new business. I made up my own events pages with a filter for my clients to find those events which best suit them, and it worked well but for technical problem down the line, that could not be solved. I have since had to delete this and install the Wix Events & Tickets App. I am now wanting to get code to the filter and to integrate it into this app.
I live in Johannesburg South Africa
Im 66
The business is an events dating business where I will create events for all age groups and for every weekend.
